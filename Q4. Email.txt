Subject: Data Quality Issue Detected in Product Dataset

Dear [Business Leader's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share an important update regarding our product dataset.

We've discovered missing values in certain fields, which could impact our decision-making processes. Accurate data is
crucial for making informed decisions, and these missing values might affect our ability to analyze product trends
accurately.

Our team is actively investigating the root causes of these missing values. We're implementing data validation checks
to prevent future occurrences and optimize data quality. As we address this issue, we're also considering performance
and scaling concerns to maintain system efficiency.

Your insights into any recent changes or affected fields would be invaluable as we work to enhance our data quality.
Could we discuss this further at your convenience?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Jiahuan He
